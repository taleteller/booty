Contao Backend Theme - Booty
=================================

Over the years I have become a big fan of Contao Content Management as well as the Bootstrap Framework, developing websites with both of them. However, the Contao backend has aged a little, compared with how we do websites nowadays. Of course catchy optics are no focus of a backend, but usability and screen sizes have evolved as well the past years. Especially web developers tend to have big screens, and the default Contao backend tends to become tiny on them. Sometimes we use small screen devices as well, thus the solution for the backend is the same as for frontend - responsible webdesign. 

However, theming the Contao Backend is made with pure CSS as there is no way to touch the backend templates within a theme. Therefore we are stuck with the naming and page structures, and can't implement a real bootstrap framework for the whole deal. This theme can't include Bootstrap, but it can wrap it's solutions around the backend, making it look like it where involved. That's why it's called "Booty", for being 'like' made with Bootstrap. 


Requirements
-------------

* Contao 3.3.0+ (Not tested below that version)

Browser Compatibility
----------------------

This theme is heavily relying on CSS3 as it's supported by modern browsers. Thus, it's no use to open tickets being not working fine on your historical Explorer 8 oder Firefox 3.5. Beside it's not the best idea to use such dinosaurs for plenty of reasons. However, if you got improvements for modern age browsers feel welcome to provide. 

Features
---------

* Full flexible width layout (Limited to a maximum width of 1920px).
* Slightly enlarged good readable fonts.
* Bootstrap like design for buttons and navigation.
* Replaces most glyphs, but keeps compatibility with plugin provided ones.
* Hides button text and enlarges glyphs on low resolutions.
* Flexible form widths!
* Releases many constrains blocking responsibility.
* Themes login page as well, and can therefore be configured as 'default'. 
* It's mostly shades of gray - but hey, it's a backend, get your colorful inspirations to the frontend! ;-)

Limitations & Bugs
-------------------

This theme is mostly limited by the code structure Contao is providing it's pages with. Therefore not everything is possible, and sometimes quite a hassle to please all big browsers in these constrains. There also might be issues i have not found yet.
